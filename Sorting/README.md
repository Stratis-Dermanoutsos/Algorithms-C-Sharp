# No return


As you may have noticed, these *Classes do not return the sorted array.

Instead, they prepare an output string.


**This is for output and example purposes, can be changed to return the sorted array with simple steps.



Each algorithm has its own class for my own writing purposes. 

Of course, also very easy to convert to 1 class with multiple sorting methods.
